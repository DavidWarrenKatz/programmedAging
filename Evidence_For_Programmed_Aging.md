# Evidence For Aging As An Active and Robust Process of Self-Destruction

## Aging Is A Stage of Development

Human life can be divided into distinct stages of development, including stages of aging. Each stage is associated with distinct biological characteristics and distinct liklihood of diseases.

- **Infancy**: 0–2 years  
- **Childhood**: 3–12 years  
- **Adolescence**: 13–19 years  
- **Young Adulthood**: 20–39 years  
- **Adulthood**: 40–49 years  
- **Youngest-old**: 50–65 years  
- **Old**: 66–85 years  
- **Oldest-old**: 86–99 years  
- **Centenarians**: 100–110 years  
- **Supercentenarians**: 111+ years  

The population-level risk of developing cancer increases until the "old" stage (66–85 years) but begins to decline in the "oldest-old" (86–99 years). This phenomenon has two potential explanations:  
1. **Slower Aging Program**:  
   The actual individual-level risk of developing cancer decreases in the oldest-old stage of development. This biological slowdown in cancer susceptibility is then reflected in the population-level decrease in cancer risk.

2. **Survivorship Bias**:
   While the individual-level risk of developing cancer continues to increase for all organisms with age, but the rate of increase is much slower in those that survive to the oldest-old stage. This results in the population-level risk of cancer decreasing for those that manage to survivor to the oldest-old stage. 

## The Best Methods of Life Extension Interfer With Active Pathways 

The most effective methods of extending animal lifespan—caloric restriction, exercise, young blood transfusions, castration, and knocking out certain genes—all revolve around disrupting the body's active pathways, rather than cooperating with the body or clearing damage.  
Remarkably, old organisms are rejuvenated by young blood, and old blood is toxic to the young organisms [3]. For male organisms, castration leads to significant life extension in worms, flies, mice, and men [4]. Young blood transfusions and castration lead to life extension by interfering with active pathways, not by clearing damage.  
Two other life extension mechanisms are exercise and caloric restriction. No presently available therapeutic or medical technology has shown anywhere near the same effects at extending lifespan as strenuous exercise and drastic caloric restriction. A responsible physician would tell you this. Caloric restriction and exercise lead to life extension by tricking the body into thinking it is in an adverse environment, not by working with the body. Anything your body does in response to exercise and caloric restriction, it could do in well-fed and less active conditions. However, your body is not trying its best to survive. Your body performs best only when it is tricked into thinking there is no risk of overpopulation or is tricked into thinking there is a high risk of death from external causes.  
Extension of life in the presence of stressors is only possible because the body is holding some of its abilities in reserve. It follows that the body is not evolved to live as long as possible. Evolution has selected for aging, and the rate of death is being carefully modulated by evolution.  
Aging genes have been discovered in every organism in which they have been sought. A gene is classified as an “aging gene” if the organism lives longer when that gene is knocked-out. Examples of aging genes are DAF-2 in nematodes [5] and components of the DREAM complex in mice [6]. These genes are components of active chemical pathways that have been evolutionarily conserved across various species. These aging genes have an ancient origin. They have homologs in organisms across the tree of life, going back to the simplest eukaryotes. Evolution has preserved these aging genes with the same conservatism as it has preserved the core metabolic functions essential to all life. Evolution has selected for active self-destruction. This is ‘how’ aging happens.  
The weight of scientific evidence leans towards aging being an active process of self-destruction.
