# Evidence For Aging As An Active and Robust Process of Self-Destruction

## There are many stages of the aging process, just as there are many stages of the developmental process.

Evolution shapes the post-reproductive lifespan of organisms. While evolutionary pressures for survival often diminish after reproduction, this reduction is not arbitrary. Instead, the programmed theory of aging contends that the reduction in survival post reproduction is the result of biological processes that are structured and robust. This is supported by the observation that aging occurs in distinct stages. Just as development is marked by predictable, biologically distinct stages, such as embryogenesis and adolescence, aging also progresses through well-defined phases. Each stage of aging is associated with unique biological characteristics and risks, reflecting how evolution has fine-tuned each of these phases. A possible framework for categorizing these stages is as follows:

- **Embryogenesis**: Fertilization to 8 weeks  
- **Fetal Stage**: 9 weeks to birth
- **Infancy**: 0–2 years  
- **Childhood**: 3–12 years  
- **Adolescence**: 13–19 years  
- **Young Adulthood**: 20–39 years  
- **Adulthood**: 40–49 years  
- **Youngest-old**: 50–65 years  
- **Old**: 66–85 years  
- **Oldest-old**: 86–99 years  
- **Centenarians**: 100–110 years  
- **Supercentenarians**: 111+ years  

The population-level risk of developing certain disease depends on the stage of life. For example, the population-level risk of developing cancer increases until the end of the "old" stage (66–85 years), and then begins to decline in the "oldest-old" stage (86–99 years) [Bonafè, M. et al., 2002]. Likewise, the population-level risk of developing rhuematoid arthritis increases until the end of the "youngest old" stage (66–85 years), and then begins to decline in the "old" stage (66–85 years). These observed trends in population-level disease risk suggest two possible explanations for individual-level risk, which is inherently more difficult—if not impossible—to measure directly.

1. **There are distinct stages of aging, each with its own risk of cancer.** According to this perspective, the actual individual-level risk of developing cancer decreases in the "oldest-old" stage of development. This biological slowdown in cancer susceptibility is then reflected in the population-level decrease in cancer risk.

2. **There is a single stage of aging with statistical variations among individuals.** Alternatively, from the non-programmed perspective, aging is viewed as a single stage during which the body is continually attempting, but failing, to survive. In this framework, the individual-level cancer risk always increases after reproduction. The population-level risk decrease observed in the "oldest-old" stage is attributed to survivorship bias. Individuals with slower rates of aging and lower cancer susceptibility tend to survive longer. As the people who have a high individual risk of cancer begin to die off, there is an inflection point in which the population-level risk of cancer decreases for those people who happened to survive into the "oldest-old" stage. From this perspective, the "oldest-old" is not a biologically distinct phase that a human enters after going through "fourth puberty", but a statistical artifact.

These two explanations make distinct predictions:  

1. **Biological Stages Predictions:** Firstly, there are biological triggers for transitioning from the "old" to the "oldest-old" stage, analogous to the role of hormones in puberty. Secondly, the likelihoods of disease and the transitions between stages would remain unchanged even if measured in a much larger population size. Since the stages are determined by biological mechanisms rather than statistical phenomena, increasing the number of organisms would not alter these patterns.
   
4. **Statistical Artifact Predictions:** With a sufficiently large population, the statistical artifacts responsible for the appearance of population-level stages of aging could diminish or even disappear entirely. Even if the stages persist, the likelihoods of disease and the timing of transitions may shift due to the change in variability in the larger datasets. A key prediction of this theory is that, given enough people, at least one individual could potentially live to 200 years or beyond, since statistical extremes become more likely in larger populations.  

A common criticism of the programmed theory of aging is the absence of long-lived mutants. If aging is truly programmed, we might expect to see humans with mutations in their biological clocks, allowing them to live dramatically longer—perhaps even more than 500 years. The reason there are no long-lived mutants is that the aging program is highly robust to spontaneous mutations. The aging program has developed ways to deal with the spontaneous mutations that arise in nature, just as the developmental program has developed ways to deal with the insult of the embryo being divided into two. To truly reverse aging, a more targeted and coordinated insult to the body is needed. Evolution, while robust, is not invincible. There are specific challenges to the genome and the body that evolution cannot handle. A coordinated and targeted insult to the body’s biological clocks is the most promising aging intervention. We need interventions that break things down and target the clock, not interventions that clear damage.
The lack of ‘immortal’ mutants in nature is indeed very significant, and is one of the strongest arguments for programmed aging. To understand this, it is important to differentiate between arbitrarily rare events and meaningfully rare events. Consider the example of a basketball player from Indiana making a shot from a particular point on a particular court while wearing green shorts. It is certainly true that a rare event has occurred. However, this is not a meaningfully rare event. This event is rare only due to arbitrary considerations like the color of the players' shorts. If the player were wearing blue shorts instead of green shorts, it is not clear the event would be more rare. For every meaningful rare event, there is always a clear way in which the event could have been more rare.
In contrast, imagine flipping 100 coins and having all of them land on heads. This is a meaningfully rare event because there is a clear way to make it even rarer: flipping 101 coins and having all of them land on heads as well. Meaningfully rare events do happen, and their occurrence or nonoccurrence can offer valuable insights. Over enough trials, we expect meaningfully rare events to happen, no matter how improbable they seem. For instance, if you conduct the coin-flipping experiment repeatedly, you would expect all 100 coins to land on heads eventually. However, if after an extraordinary number of trials such an outcome never occurs, we would increasingly question the assumption that the coins are independent and fair. Instead, it would be likely that there was some mechanism preventing this rare outcome—something that keeps track of the coin flips and interferes to ensure that not all coins land on heads. 
If organisms die as a result of the aging program allowing damage to accumulate, we would expect some organisms to live much longer than others simply by chance. If aging were merely the result of random damage building up over time, and populations were large enough, then we would expect some individuals to avoid damage long enough to live vastly beyond their expected lifespan. Yet, this is not what we observe in nature. There is strong evidence that organisms have a biologically programmed maximum lifespan. Aging interventions generally extend median lifespan without extending maximum lifespan. Aging interventions generally result in ‘squared’ survival curves, where organisms spend more of their life healthy, but all the organisms still die around the same upper limit. Like the coins that seem to be ‘watched’ by some external force to ensure they don’t all land on heads, the aging process appears to be regulated in such a way that no individual escapes the built-in limits of their biological lifespan. 
The concept of a biologically programmed maximum lifespan suggests that organisms may possess a death program separate from their aging program. The aging program, governed by biological clocks, allows damage to accumulate gradually, reducing an organism’s fitness and transitioning the organisms into a more vulnerable grandfatherly role. Over time, this damage makes survival less likely, but it does not directly cause death. Instead, the existence of a maximum lifespan suggests the presence of a death program—a programmed mechanism, also governed by biological clocks, that ensures an organism dies at a certain point, regardless of accumulated damage. This death program may work similarly to the well-known death programs observed in species like bamboo plants, octopuses, and cicadas, where organisms die all at once after reproduction.





## The Best Methods of Life Extension Interfer With Active Pathways 

The most effective methods of extending animal lifespan—caloric restriction, exercise, young blood transfusions, castration, and knocking out certain genes—all revolve around disrupting the body's active pathways, rather than cooperating with the body or clearing damage.  
Remarkably, old organisms are rejuvenated by young blood, and old blood is toxic to the young organisms [3]. For male organisms, castration leads to significant life extension in worms, flies, mice, and men [4]. Young blood transfusions and castration lead to life extension by interfering with active pathways, not by clearing damage.  
Two other life extension mechanisms are exercise and caloric restriction. No presently available therapeutic or medical technology has shown anywhere near the same effects at extending lifespan as strenuous exercise and drastic caloric restriction. A responsible physician would tell you this. Caloric restriction and exercise lead to life extension by tricking the body into thinking it is in an adverse environment, not by working with the body. Anything your body does in response to exercise and caloric restriction, it could do in well-fed and less active conditions. However, your body is not trying its best to survive. Your body performs best only when it is tricked into thinking there is no risk of overpopulation or is tricked into thinking there is a high risk of death from external causes.  
Extension of life in the presence of stressors is only possible because the body is holding some of its abilities in reserve. It follows that the body is not evolved to live as long as possible. Evolution has selected for aging, and the rate of death is being carefully modulated by evolution.  
Aging genes have been discovered in every organism in which they have been sought. A gene is classified as an “aging gene” if the organism lives longer when that gene is knocked-out. Examples of aging genes are DAF-2 in nematodes [5] and components of the DREAM complex in mice [6]. These genes are components of active chemical pathways that have been evolutionarily conserved across various species. These aging genes have an ancient origin. They have homologs in organisms across the tree of life, going back to the simplest eukaryotes. Evolution has preserved these aging genes with the same conservatism as it has preserved the core metabolic functions essential to all life. Evolution has selected for active self-destruction. This is ‘how’ aging happens.  
The weight of scientific evidence leans towards aging being an active process of self-destruction.
