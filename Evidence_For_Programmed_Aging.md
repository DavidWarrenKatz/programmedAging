# Evidence For Aging As An Active and Robust Process of Self-Destruction

## There are many stages of the aging process, just as there are many stages of the developmental process.

Evolution shapes the post-reproductive lifespan of organisms. While evolutionary pressures for survival often diminish after reproduction, this reduction is not arbitrary. Instead, the programmed theory of aging contends that the reduction in survival post reproduction is the result of biological processes that are structured and robust. This is supported by the observation that aging occurs in distinct stages. Just as development is marked by predictable, biologically distinct stages, such as embryogenesis and adolescence, aging also progresses through well-defined phases. Each stage of aging is associated with unique biological characteristics and risks, reflecting how evolution has fine-tuned each of these phases. A possible framework for categorizing these stages is as follows:

- **Embryogenesis**: Fertilization to 8 weeks  
- **Fetal Stage**: 9 weeks to birth
- **Infancy**: 0–2 years  
- **Childhood**: 3–12 years  
- **Adolescence**: 13–19 years  
- **Young Adulthood**: 20–39 years  
- **Adulthood**: 40–49 years  
- **Youngest-old**: 50–65 years  
- **Old**: 66–85 years  
- **Oldest-old**: 86–99 years  
- **Centenarians**: 100–110 years  
- **Supercentenarians**: 111+ years  

The population-level risk of developing certain disease depends on the stage of life. For example, the population-level risk of developing cancer increases until the end of the "old" stage (66–85 years), and then begins to decline in the "oldest-old" stage (86–99 years) [Bonafè, M. et al., 2002]. Likewise, the population-level risk of developing rhuematoid arthritis increases until the end of the "youngest old" stage (66–85 years), and then begins to decline in the "old" stage (66–85 years). These observed trends in population-level disease risk suggest two possible explanations for individual-level risk, which is inherently more difficult—if not impossible—to measure directly.

1. **There are distinct stages of aging, each with its own risk of cancer.** According to this perspective, the actual individual-level risk of developing cancer decreases in the "oldest-old" stage of development. This biological slowdown in cancer susceptibility is then reflected in the population-level decrease in cancer risk.

2. **There is a single stage of aging with statistical variations among individuals.** Alternatively, from the non-programmed perspetive, aging is viewed as a single stage during which the body is continually attempting, but failing, to maintain survival. In this framework, the individual-level cancer risk always increases after reproduction. The population-level risk decrease observed in the "oldest-old" stage is attributed to survivorship bias. Individuals with slower rates of aging and lower cancer susceptibility tend to survive longer. As the people who have a high individual risk of cancer begin to die off, there is an inflection point in which the population-level risk of cancer decreases for those people that happened to survive into the "oldest-old" stage. From this perspective, the "oldest-old" is not a biologically distinct phase that a human enters after going through "fourth puberty", but a statistical artifact.

If similar declines in cancer risk occur across all populations, regardless of genetic diversity, this would favor the explanation that the individual-level risk of cancer is actually decreasing at that stage in development. Variation in patterns would suggest survivorship bias due to demographic differences. The population-level decrease in cancer risk among the oldest-old would become less pronounced or even disappear as the population increases. If the decline in cancer risk is due to survivorship bias, then increasing the population size introduces more variability. A larger population would include more individuals who lack the genetic or environmental advantages required to survive to the oldest-old stage. This would dilute the effects of survivorship bias, making the population-level decrease in cancer risk less apparent.

## The Best Methods of Life Extension Interfer With Active Pathways 

The most effective methods of extending animal lifespan—caloric restriction, exercise, young blood transfusions, castration, and knocking out certain genes—all revolve around disrupting the body's active pathways, rather than cooperating with the body or clearing damage.  
Remarkably, old organisms are rejuvenated by young blood, and old blood is toxic to the young organisms [3]. For male organisms, castration leads to significant life extension in worms, flies, mice, and men [4]. Young blood transfusions and castration lead to life extension by interfering with active pathways, not by clearing damage.  
Two other life extension mechanisms are exercise and caloric restriction. No presently available therapeutic or medical technology has shown anywhere near the same effects at extending lifespan as strenuous exercise and drastic caloric restriction. A responsible physician would tell you this. Caloric restriction and exercise lead to life extension by tricking the body into thinking it is in an adverse environment, not by working with the body. Anything your body does in response to exercise and caloric restriction, it could do in well-fed and less active conditions. However, your body is not trying its best to survive. Your body performs best only when it is tricked into thinking there is no risk of overpopulation or is tricked into thinking there is a high risk of death from external causes.  
Extension of life in the presence of stressors is only possible because the body is holding some of its abilities in reserve. It follows that the body is not evolved to live as long as possible. Evolution has selected for aging, and the rate of death is being carefully modulated by evolution.  
Aging genes have been discovered in every organism in which they have been sought. A gene is classified as an “aging gene” if the organism lives longer when that gene is knocked-out. Examples of aging genes are DAF-2 in nematodes [5] and components of the DREAM complex in mice [6]. These genes are components of active chemical pathways that have been evolutionarily conserved across various species. These aging genes have an ancient origin. They have homologs in organisms across the tree of life, going back to the simplest eukaryotes. Evolution has preserved these aging genes with the same conservatism as it has preserved the core metabolic functions essential to all life. Evolution has selected for active self-destruction. This is ‘how’ aging happens.  
The weight of scientific evidence leans towards aging being an active process of self-destruction.
