**Summary**:  
The authors activated mouse CD8+ T cells in vivo using a heterologous prime–boost–boost vaccination strategy. Expanded cells from middle-aged (~1 year old) mice were transferred to younger (8–10 weeks old) mice, and this process was repeated iteratively with the same T cells. Remarkably, over 10 years, these T cells retained their ability to respond to vaccination at levels comparable to young endogenous T cells. Some of the original T cells expanded by at least 10^40-fold during this period, far exceeding the normal proliferative and longevity capacities of T cells. Despite this unprecedented expansion and longevity, the T cells did not become cancerous but did display some signs of exhaustion, such as the expression of the ‘senescence marker’ KLRG1.


**Commentary**:  
I hypothesize that the important factor is number of days in the young body, not the number of days between immunizations. The authors, on the other hand, believe the number of days between immunizations and the T cells' need to rest is the iportant factor in determining their rejuventaion. This could be tested by allowing the T cells to be in the body for a longer before the short immunization periods. However, T cells self-destruct after immune stimulation, which is likely why the authors
