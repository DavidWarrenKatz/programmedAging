**Summary**:  
In this study, the authors investigate the ability of T cells to undergo extensive cell divisions beyond their initial antigen-driven response. They demonstrate that T cells retain the capability for numerous divisions throughout their lifespan, which contributes to their longevity and sustained immune function. The research highlights that these divisions are not merely a result of external signals but are an intrinsic capacity of T cells. This discovery provides insights into the long-term maintenance of T cell populations and their role in immune memory and disease prevention.

**Commentary**:  
This work challenges the conventional understanding that T cells have limited replicative potential after their initial activation. By showing that T cells can divide beyond what was previously thought, it opens up avenues for enhancing immune therapies, particularly in the context of chronic infections and cancer. It suggests that therapeutic strategies could aim to harness or boost this intrinsic capacity for division, potentially leading to more effective long-term immune responses.
