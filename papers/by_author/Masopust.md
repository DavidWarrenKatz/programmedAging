**Andrew G. Soerens et al. and David Masopust, Nature, 2022**  

**Summary**:  
The authors activated mouse CD8+ T cells in vivo using a heterologous prime–boost–boost vaccination strategy. Expanded cells from middle-aged (~1 year old) mice were transferred to younger (8–10 weeks old) mice, and this process was repeated iteratively with the same T cells. Remarkably, over 10 years, these T cells retained their ability to respond to vaccination at levels comparable to young endogenous T cells. Some of the original T cells expanded by at least 10^40-fold during this period, far exceeding the normal proliferative and longevity capacities of T cells. Despite this unprecedented expansion and longevity, the T cells did not become cancerous but did display some signs of exhaustion, such as the expression of the ‘senescence marker’ KLRG1.

**Commentary**:  
I hypothesize that the critical factor is the number of days the T cells spend in a young body, rather than the interval between immunizations. The authors, however, suggest that the time between immunizations and the need for T cells to rest are the key factors in their rejuvenation. This could be tested by allowing the T cells to remain in the young body for a longer period before administering the short immunization intervals. However, T cells tend to self-destruct after immune stimulation, which may be why the authors chose to transfer and vaccinate the young mice immediately after the previous vaccination.
