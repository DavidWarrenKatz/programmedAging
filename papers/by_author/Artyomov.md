**Summary**:  
In this study, Artyomov and colleagues provide a detailed profiling of the aging immune system in both humans and mice, identifying clonal GZMK+ CD8+ T cells as a conserved feature of inflammaging. These GZMK+ CD8+ T cells accumulate with age and contribute to a chronic inflammatory state that characterizes aged immune systems. The study highlights these cells as potential markers of immune aging and suggests that targeting this population could alleviate age-related inflammation.

**Commentary**:  
This research significantly advances our understanding of the immune components contributing to inflammaging, particularly the role of clonal expansions in CD8+ T cells. The identification of conserved markers like GZMK+ CD8+ T cells opens avenues for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune function in aging populations. This work underscores the potential for rejuvenating immune responses by selectively targeting cells that drive chronic inflammation without affecting the broader immune functionality.
