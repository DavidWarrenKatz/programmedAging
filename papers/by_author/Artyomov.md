**Summary**:  
The authors generated a multi-omics single cell dataset of the immune system and compared this dataset with public datasets. By analysing this new dataset, the authors found that a population of clonal Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells emerge in old mice. This observation can not yet be confirmed by flow cytometry, but was confimed by analysis of public datasets, mice cell lines, and human samples. 

scRNA was performed on approximately 35,000 cells from four tissues (spleen, peritoneom, lungs, liver) and two age-points (3-6 months and 17-24 months) in six male C57BL/6J mice. For each tissue, dimensionality reduction was used to call cell-type clusters. Within each cluster, differential expression analysis for each timepoint was performed. Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells were identifed as being significantly upregulated in old age mice in all four tissues by this analysis. 

Next, flow cytometry on an independent cohort of mice was used to validate. 

provide a detailed profiling of the aging immune system in both humans and mice, identifying clonal GZMK+ CD8+ T cells as a conserved feature of inflammaging. These GZMK+ CD8+ T cells accumulate with age and contribute to a chronic inflammatory state that characterizes aged immune systems. The study highlights these cells as potential markers of immune aging and suggests that targeting this population could alleviate age-related inflammation.

**Commentary**:  
This research significantly advances our understanding of the immune components contributing to inflammaging, particularly the role of clonal expansions in CD8+ T cells. The identification of conserved markers like GZMK+ CD8+ T cells opens avenues for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune function in aging populations. This work underscores the potential for rejuvenating immune responses by selectively targeting cells that drive chronic inflammation without affecting the broader immune functionality.
