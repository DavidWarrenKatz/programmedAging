**Summary**:  
The authors generated a multi-omics single cell dataset of the immune system and identified a new class of CD8+ T cells that emerges with aging in mice and men. This emergence was then confirmed in public (better quality) datasets as well as heterochronic transfer experiments. These aging-associated CD8+ clonal T cells (Taa) were characterized by their expression of Gzmk as well as their co-expression of the transcription factor TOX (exhaustion) and the checkpoint molecule PD-1. This emergence of this cell population with age cannot yet be confirmed by flow cytometry, but was supported by other approaches. Gzmk was not detected in cells other than this subpopulation of T cells.

scRNA was performed on approximately 35,000 cells from four tissues (spleen, peritoneom, lungs, liver) and two age-points (3-6 months and 17-24 months) in six male C57BL/6J mice. For each tissue, highly variable with respect to age genes were selected and then dimensionality reduction was performed on variable genes to call cell-type clusters. Within each cluster, subclusters were called by measuring expression levels of a list of marker genes. For each subcluster, differential expression analysis for each of the two timepoints was performed. Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells were identifed as being significantly upregulated in old age mice in all four tissues by this analysis. 

**Validating Aging Associated Populations with Flow Cytometry**:

Some of the age-association population changes could be confirmed by flow cytometry, such as the depletion of peritoneum macrophages. For example, in Figure 2A, flow cytometry on an independent cohort of mice was used to seperate macrophages and dendritic cells, and then a new round of scRNA-Seq was performed on the macrophages and dendritic cells. ICAM2 expression was specific to peritoneal macrophages and dendritic cells, and flow cytometry confirmed a significant decrease in ICAM2+ macrophages in the mouse peritoneum with age (Figure 2C).   



Contrary to the CD4+ T cells, the authors observed an increased clonality among aged CD8+ T cells that was concentrated within the CD8+ Taa cell clusters but not within the Tem subsets (Figures 3F–3H and S3A–S3E).

provide a detailed profiling of the aging immune system in both humans and mice, identifying clonal GZMK+ CD8+ T cells as a conserved feature of inflammaging. These GZMK+ CD8+ T cells accumulate with age and contribute to a chronic inflammatory state that characterizes aged immune systems. The study highlights these cells as potential markers of immune aging and suggests that targeting this population could alleviate age-related inflammation.

**Commentary**:  
This research significantly advances our understanding of the immune components contributing to inflammaging, particularly the role of clonal expansions in CD8+ T cells. The identification of conserved markers like GZMK+ CD8+ T cells opens avenues for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune function in aging populations. This work underscores the potential for rejuvenating immune responses by selectively targeting cells that drive chronic inflammation without affecting the broader immune functionality.
