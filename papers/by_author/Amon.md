### 1. [**Cell size is a determinant of stem cell potential during aging** ](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abk0271)
**Jette Lengefeld, Angelika Amon et al., Science Advances, 2021**  

**Summary**:  
The authors demonstrate that as cells age, they increase in size, which negatively impacts the regenerative potential of stem cells. The study shows that smaller stem cells retain a higher regenerative potential than their larger counterparts, suggesting that cell size is a determinant of stem cell potency during aging. This work has significant implications for understanding aging and the potential for rejuvenating stem cell function.

**Commentary**:  
This research has broadened the understanding of how intrinsic cellular factors, like size, impact aging. It challenges the previous assumption that stem cell potential is solely influenced by genetic factors, highlighting the importance of biophysical properties such as size. Future therapies for age-related diseases could potentially target mechanisms controlling cell size to maintain or enhance stem cell function.

### 2. [**Gametogenesis eliminates age-induced cellular damage and resets lifespan in yeast**  ](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1204349)
**Elçin Ünal, Angelika Amon et al., Science, 2011**  

**Summary**:  
In this study, Ünal and her team explored how gametogenesis in yeast resets the aging clock. They found that during gametogenesis, age-induced cellular damage is eliminated, effectively restoring the lifespan of the newly generated cells. Yeast cells lacking Cdc5 are not able to undergo meiotic division, but are still able to sense nutrients deprivation and undergo sporulation. As a result, under conditions that normally induce sporulation in yeast, yeast cells lacking Cdc5 transition from a vegetative cell into a single spore rather than the usual four spores. This single spore is still born young. All hallmarks of aging are erased, including amyloid aggregates.

**Commentary**:  
A possible conclusion from this study is that dilution and asymmetric division are not responsible for the clearing of age-associated damage, such as amyloid, as there was no cell division. One interpretation is that the yeast cell always had the ability to clear amyloid without dilution or asymmetric division or any addition of energy. The yeast cell, however, allowed the damage to accumulate as directed by its aging program. The hypothesis that there is an aging clock upstream of amyloid accumulation directing the accumulation simply explains this observation of single yeast spores being born young. Another explanation could be that there is a hidden asymmetry in this scenario. While normal meiosis causes aggregates to segregate to the “GUNC”, it’s not clear if GUNC formation is blocked in CDC5mn cells. This suggests repeating the experiment and blocking the formation of GUNC.

The CDC5mn spore may be analogous to a new cell within an old cell? Does this matter?
