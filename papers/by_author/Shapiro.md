### 1. [**How Life Changes Itself: The Read–Write (RW) Genome**](https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/shapiro-read-write-genome.pdf)  
**James A. Shapiro, 2009**

**Summary**:  
This paper introduces the concept of the genome as a dynamic read–write (RW) system, contrasting the traditional view of the genome as a static repository of information. Shapiro argues that cells actively modify their own genomes in response to environmental stimuli, utilizing various molecular tools such as transposable elements, recombination systems, and epigenetic mechanisms. The RW genome model suggests that organisms play an active role in their evolution by reshaping their genetic code throughout their lifetimes, rather than being passive recipients of random mutations.

**Commentary**:  
Shapiro's RW genome concept challenges the classical "central dogma" of molecular biology, where information flow is unidirectional from DNA to RNA to protein. Instead, this paper highlights the genome's adaptability and its role in evolutionary innovation, suggesting that cells are capable of sophisticated self-engineering. This idea has profound implications for our understanding of evolution, genetic regulation, and the potential for therapeutic interventions that harness the genome's inherent plasticity.
