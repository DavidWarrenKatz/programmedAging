### 1. [**Slowing of Mortality Rates at Older Ages in Large Medfly Cohorts**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1411540/)  
**James R. Carey, et al., Science, 1992**

**Summary**:  
This groundbreaking study analyzed mortality rates in large cohorts of Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) and found that mortality rates decelerate at older ages. Contrary to traditional aging theories that predict a constant increase in mortality with age, this paper revealed that death rates level off or even decline at extreme old ages in medflies. This phenomenon suggests that mortality may not be an inevitable outcome of biological aging and that some organisms may experience a form of late-life mortality plateau.

**Commentary**:  
The findings from this study challenge the conventional view of aging, suggesting that biological mortality may be more flexible than previously thought. By showing a slowing of death rates in older medflies, this research opens up new avenues for studying the aging process, with potential implications for human aging and longevity. This work has had a significant impact on the field of demography and gerontology, sparking debates about the universality of age-related mortality patterns across species.
