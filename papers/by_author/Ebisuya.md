### 1. [**Reconstituting Developmental Timing in Vitro: A Synthetic Approach to Understand Biological Clocks**]  
**Miki Ebisuya, et al., Cell, 2021**

**Summary**:  
This paper explores how developmental timing can be reconstituted in vitro using synthetic biology approaches. Ebisuya and her team successfully recreated biological clocks in artificial environments, providing insights into how cells control timing during development. By mimicking developmental processes outside of a living organism, the study uncovers key mechanisms that govern cellular timekeeping, with implications for understanding species-specific developmental rates.

**Commentary**:  
Ebisuya’s research opens new possibilities for synthetic biology, offering a powerful tool to study developmental timing without relying on whole organisms. This innovative approach provides an exciting platform to explore how biological clocks are regulated and how cells keep track of time during complex developmental processes. The findings also contribute to broader discussions on evolutionary differences in developmental timing across species.

### 2. [**Comparative Analysis of Human and Chimpanzee Cells Reveals Species-Specific Timing Mechanisms**]  
**Miki Ebisuya, et al., Nature, 2018**

**Summary**:  
This study compares human and chimpanzee cells to investigate the differences in developmental timing between the two species. The research reveals that species-specific differences in timing arise from distinct cellular processes, particularly in how cells regulate their internal clocks. Ebisuya and her team identified critical factors that contribute to these timing variations, providing new insights into the evolutionary divergence of developmental rates.

**Commentary**:  
The comparative approach used by Ebisuya highlights how small molecular differences can lead to significant variations in developmental timing between species. The study contributes to the broader understanding of evolutionary biology and how developmental clocks have adapted in different organisms. These findings have potential applications in evolutionary developmental biology and the study of human-specific traits.
