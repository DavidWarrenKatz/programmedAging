**Summary**:  
This paper explores the emergence of replication timing during early mammalian development, focusing on how DNA replication is temporally coordinated as embryos progress from zygotes to more specialized cells. The researchers identify that replication timing patterns, which regulate when different regions of the genome are replicated during the cell cycle, are established at an early stage of development. These patterns are tightly linked to cellular differentiation and genome organization, playing a critical role in shaping cell fate decisions.

**Commentary**:  
The discovery of how replication timing emerges and becomes established during early development is crucial for understanding cellular differentiation and genome integrity. Torres-Padilla’s research provides deep insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the timing of DNA replication, which may have significant implications for developmental biology and diseases associated with genomic instability, such as cancer. By elucidating these early developmental processes, the study opens new avenues for exploring how replication timing influences cell identity.
