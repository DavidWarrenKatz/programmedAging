### 1. [**Metabolic Regulation of Species-Specific Developmental Rates**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05574-4)  
**Margarete Diaz-Cuadros, Teemu P. Miettinen, Owen S. Skinner, Dylan Sheedy, Carlos Manlio Díaz-García, Svetlana Gapon, Alexis Hubaud, Gary Yellen, Scott R. Manalis, William M. Oldham, Olivier Pourquié, Nature, 2023**

**Summary**:  
This paper explores how metabolic processes regulate species-specific developmental rates in vertebrates. The researchers demonstrate that metabolic activity plays a crucial role in determining the pace of development, influencing species-specific timelines for growth. By comparing metabolic markers and developmental timing across different species, the study highlights metabolism as a key driver of developmental rate differences among vertebrates.

**Commentary**:  
This study uncovers a fundamental link between metabolism and developmental speed, suggesting that metabolic regulation could underlie species-specific growth rates. Diaz-Cuadros and her colleagues' research opens new pathways for understanding how metabolic adjustments might affect developmental processes, offering insights that could have applications in developmental biology and regenerative medicine, particularly in addressing growth-related disorders.

### 2. [**In Vitro Characterization of the Human Segmentation Clock**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1885-9)  
**Margarete Diaz-Cuadros, Daniel E. Wagner, Christoph Budjan, Alexis Hubaud, Oscar A. Tarazona, Sophia Donelly, Arthur Michaut, Ziad Al Tanoury, Kumiko Yoshioka-Kobayashi, Yusuke Niino, Ryoichiro Kageyama, Atsushi Miyawaki, Jonathan Touboul, Olivier Pourquié, Nature, 2020**

**Summary**:  
This paper provides an in-depth characterization of the human segmentation clock, a critical process involved in the formation of somites, which are the precursors to vertebrae during early embryonic development. The study utilizes in vitro systems to observe the periodic activity of the human segmentation clock, revealing human-specific features and key signaling pathways that regulate the timing of somite formation.

**Commentary**:  
By analyzing the human segmentation clock in vitro, this study offers valuable insights into the regulation of early developmental processes. The findings provide a model for understanding congenital vertebral malformations and other developmental disorders. The work of Diaz-Cuadros and her team contributes to a deeper understanding of how timing mechanisms in embryonic development are regulated and could pave the way for future therapeutic interventions.
