### 1. [**Effect of cellular and ECM aging on human iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte performance, maturity, and senescence**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961220308000)
**S. Gulberk Ozcebe et al. and  Pinar Zorlutuna et al., Biomaterials, 2021**  

**Summary**:  
A previous study by the authors showed that human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) went through accelerated senescence in culture so that 4 months in culture resembled 65-year-old human cardiac tissue. The authors hypothesize that the accelerated senescence is due to the oxygen-intensize enviroment in vitro. In this study, the authors seeded aged and young hiCMs on decellularized heart ECMs from mice of three age groups (1–3 month, 6–9 months, and 22–24 months). The young ECM rejuvenated the aged hiCMs in terms of proliferation markers, sarcomere length, ROS generation, and lipofuscin accumulation. The old ECM, on the other hand, accelerated markers of aging in young hiCMs. Overall, young hiCMs were more repsonsive to changes in the ECM than old hiCMs. 


**Commentary**:  
This model is not able to show that the longer time old cells are in the young environmnet, the more rejuventation occurs due the the fact that accelerated aging occurs in this setup. Howeer, the decellularization procedue of this experiment could be used to test the mitochodrial theory of aging. Specifically, a similar approach may be used to remove mitochondria from aged cells to study the effect of introducing young mitochondria to an old cell. The autho is exploring this avenue currently. This paper also describes how increased sarcomere length a consistent characteristic of aging. Could this increase be due to the loss of some myofibrils, causing remaining ones to expand to compensate for the structural deficit?
