### 1. [**Effect of cellular and ECM aging on human iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte performance, maturity, and senescence**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961220308000)
**S. Gulberk Ozcebe, Pinar Zorlutuna et al., Biomaterials, 2021**  

**Summary**:  
A previous study by the authors showed that human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) went through accelerated senescence in culture so that 4 months in culture  resembled 65-year-old human cardiac tissue. In this study, the authors seeded aged and young hiCMs on decellularized heart ECMs from mice of three age groups (1–3 month, 6–9 months, and 22–24 months). The young ECM rejuvenated the aged hiCMs in terms of proliferation markers, sarcomere length, ROS generation, and lipofuscin accumulation. The old ECM, on the other hand, accelerated markers of aging in young hiCMs. Overall, young hiCMs were more repsonsive to changes in the ECM than old hiCMs. 

### Key Questions & Ideas for Further Exploration

- **Control with Native Cardiomyocytes**:
  - Did the authors attempt this experiment with normal young and old cardiomyocytes rather than hiCMs? If not, what were the reasons?

- **Rejuvenating Effects of Young Cells on Aged ECM**:
  - Do young hiCMs have a rejuvenating effect on aged ECM? Are there studies exploring this potential interaction?

- **Role of Mitochondria in Cellular Aging**:
  - Has a similar experimental approach been used to remove mitochondria from aged cells to study the effect of introducing young mitochondria? I would like studies that de-mitochondria the cell just like the author decellularized the ECM. 

- **Duration of Exposure**:
  - How long were the hiCMs exposed to the young ECM environment? Understanding the time-dependent effects on rejuvenation could be crucial.

- **Mechanisms of Sarcomere Length Changes with Aging**:
  - Is increased sarcomere length a consistent characteristic of aging? Could this increase be due to the loss of some myofibrils, causing remaining ones to expand to compensate for the structural deficit?
