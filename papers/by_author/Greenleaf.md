**Summary**:  
This paper investigates the aging-associated epigenetic reprogramming of neuronal genes and its implications for brain aging and neurodegeneration. The study demonstrates that specific epigenetic changes accumulate in neurons as organisms age, potentially disrupting gene regulation and contributing to age-related cognitive decline. By leveraging single-cell epigenomic tools, the authors uncover patterns of chromatin remodeling that alter neuronal function and propose that these changes are key drivers of age-related neural dysfunction.

**Commentary**:  
This research underscores the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the aging process, particularly in the context of neuronal health. By identifying the epigenetic factors that drive cognitive decline, the study provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Greenleaf's contribution to the development of advanced epigenomic tools has been instrumental in elucidating these age-related changes, paving the way for novel strategies to combat neurodegeneration.
