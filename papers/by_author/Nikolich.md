**Summary**:  
This study investigates how aging impacts the function of effector CD8 T cells and their transcriptional programming. The authors demonstrate that the defects observed in aged CD8 T cells are largely cell-extrinsic, meaning they arise from the aged environment rather than the cells themselves. By administering the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, the researchers were able to correct these transcriptional defects, restoring the effector function of CD8 T cells in aged mice. This discovery has significant implications for boosting immune responses in older individuals through targeted cytokine therapies.

**Commentary**:  
This research provides a deeper understanding of how the aging environment compromises immune function, particularly the ability of CD8 T cells to respond effectively to infections and cancer. The finding that these defects are reversible through cytokine administration opens potential avenues for therapeutic interventions to restore immune function in the elderly. Future studies could focus on optimizing cytokine treatments to enhance immune responses in aged populations without causing adverse effects.

**Summary**:  
In this review article, Nikolich-Žugich explores how aging affects the immune system, with particular emphasis on the roles of chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and the dysregulation of T cells. The paper discusses how age-related changes in immune cell composition and function contribute to increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, and cancer. The review also covers potential strategies to rejuvenate the aging immune system, including lifestyle interventions and immune-modulating therapies.

**Commentary**:  
This comprehensive review highlights the complex interplay between inflammation and immune regulation in aging, emphasizing the need for targeted approaches to mitigate age-related immune decline. Nikolich-Žugich suggests that balancing immune activity, rather than merely enhancing it, may be key to promoting healthy aging and preventing the detrimental effects of chronic inflammation on the immune system.
