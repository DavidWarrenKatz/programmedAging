### 1. [**Coordinated Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by Brassinosteroids and the Age Pathway in Arabidopsis**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38207-z)  
**Gang Wu, et al., Nature Communications, 2023**

**Summary**:  
This paper investigates how brassinosteroids and the age pathway work together to regulate vegetative phase change in *Arabidopsis*. The research reveals that brassinosteroids, a class of plant hormones, interact with the age pathway to control the timing of the transition from juvenile to adult phases in plants. The study demonstrates that this coordinated regulation is crucial for proper plant development, affecting traits such as leaf morphology and reproductive timing.

**Commentary**:  
The study highlights the importance of hormonal and genetic pathways in controlling key developmental transitions in plants. By uncovering the interplay between brassinosteroids and the age pathway, Gang Wu and colleagues provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms behind vegetative phase changes. These findings have broader implications for understanding how plants integrate hormonal and genetic signals to modulate their growth and development.

### 2. [**Repression of miR156 by miR159 Regulates the Timing of the Juvenile-to-Adult Transition in Arabidopsis**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502449/)  
**Gang Wu, et al., PNAS, 2017**

**Summary**:  
This paper explores the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating the juvenile-to-adult transition in *Arabidopsis*. The research focuses on how miR159 represses miR156 to control the timing of this developmental phase change. The study reveals that this miRNA interaction is critical for ensuring the proper timing of the transition, influencing plant traits such as leaf shape and flowering time. This intricate regulation highlights the importance of miRNAs in plant development.

**Commentary**:  
By dissecting the regulatory network between miR159 and miR156, this study adds to our understanding of how microRNAs control key developmental processes in plants. The findings from Gang Wu and collaborators underscore the complexity of miRNA-mediated regulation in the juvenile-to-adult transition, providing potential avenues for manipulating plant growth and development through miRNA pathways. This work is particularly relevant for agricultural applications, where controlling plant maturation could enhance crop yield and resilience.
