**Summary**:  
This landmark study by Cai and colleagues uncovers a crucial role for hypothalamic stem cells in regulating the speed of aging through exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs). The researchers found that hypothalamic stem cells secrete exosomes containing miRNAs, which are involved in intercellular communication and influence the aging process throughout the body. As hypothalamic stem cells decline with age, the secretion of exosomal miRNAs diminishes, accelerating systemic aging. By replenishing these stem cells or their exosomal miRNAs, the team was able to slow down aging and extend lifespan in mice. This study highlights the hypothalamus as a key regulator of aging and suggests that manipulating hypothalamic stem cells or exosomal miRNAs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for age-related diseases.

**Commentary**:  
Cai's research offers a breakthrough in understanding how the brain controls aging and how stem cell-derived exosomal miRNAs serve as a communication channel between the hypothalamus and other tissues. This discovery opens up potential avenues for rejuvenation therapies aimed at restoring the function of hypothalamic stem cells or their exosomes to slow aging. The study provides strong evidence that aging is not just a passive process but is actively regulated by specific cells and molecules, particularly in the brain.
