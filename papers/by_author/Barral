**Summary**:  
This paper describes how yeast cells form a memory of past deceptive encounters during mating by assembling the protein Whi3 into a super-assembly. This protein complex acts as a molecular memory, allowing cells to "remember" previous mating attempts that did not result in successful reproduction. The memory is encoded by the aggregation of Whi3, which persists across multiple cell divisions, influencing the cell's future responses to similar encounters. This mechanism illustrates how single cells can form and maintain a biological memory in the absence of a nervous system.

**Commentary**:  
This study sheds light on the concept of cellular memory, showing that individual cells can retain information about past experiences through protein aggregation. The discovery of Whi3's role in memory formation in yeast could have broader implications for understanding memory mechanisms in more complex organisms. Additionally, this work opens the door for future research on how cells interpret and respond to their environments based on past experiences, with potential links to aging and disease processes.
