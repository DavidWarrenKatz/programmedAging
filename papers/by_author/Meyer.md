**Summary**:  
In this study, Meyer and colleagues investigate the molecular signatures of natural selection in the human genome, focusing on identifying genetic variants that have contributed to human adaptations. By analyzing genome-wide data, the authors uncovered several regions of the human genome that show signs of positive selection, which are likely involved in adaptations to diverse environments, including climate, diet, and pathogen exposure. The study highlights how different selection pressures have shaped the genetic diversity observed in modern human populations. Key findings include evidence of selection on genes related to immune function, skin pigmentation, and metabolic processes, underscoring how environmental factors have driven the evolution of these traits.

**Commentary**:  
Meyer's work provides critical insights into how human populations have evolved in response to varying environmental challenges. This study is a foundational piece in understanding the role of natural selection in shaping human genetic diversity and adaptation. The identification of regions under selection also has implications for understanding genetic predispositions to certain diseases, as many of the genes showing evidence of selection are linked to health-related traits. This research lays the groundwork for future studies exploring the evolutionary origins of human health and disease.
