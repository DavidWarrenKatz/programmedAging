**Summary**:  
This study investigates how the expression of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) changes during aging and in response to heterochronic parabiosis, a procedure where young and old mice share blood circulation. Keller and his team analyzed RNA samples from various tissues of both young and old mice to determine how ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), were affected by aging and the introduction of young blood. The research found that certain ncRNAs associated with aging were downregulated when old mice were connected to young mice, suggesting these molecules play a role in regulating the aging process and could potentially be targets for rejuvenation therapies.

**Commentary**:  
This paper adds to the growing body of evidence that ncRNAs are critical players in aging and tissue regeneration. By demonstrating that ncRNA expression patterns are altered in response to young blood, the study suggests a potential mechanism for how systemic factors influence aging at the molecular level. These findings provide a basis for further research into ncRNAs as therapeutic targets for age-related diseases and regeneration, making it a pivotal study in understanding the molecular underpinnings of aging.
