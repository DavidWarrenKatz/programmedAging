**Summary**:  
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, a critical component of innate immunity that detects cytosolic DNA and triggers an immune response. Imler and his colleagues trace the evolutionary origins of this signaling cassette, highlighting its primordial role in antiviral defense across various species. The authors discuss how the cGAS-STING pathway has been conserved and adapted through evolution to detect intracellular pathogens and how its dysregulation can lead to autoinflammatory diseases.

**Commentary**:  
Imler’s analysis of the evolutionary trajectory of cGAS-STING provides valuable insights into how ancient immune mechanisms have been co-opted and refined over time. The study suggests that the cGAS-STING pathway may have originally evolved as a defense against bacterial DNA, before expanding its role to include viral detection. This research not only sheds light on the biological significance of cGAS-STING but also opens avenues for exploring its therapeutic potential in treating viral infections, cancers, and inflammatory conditions.
