**Summary**:  
This paper examines the effects of increased cell size on the proteome and its contribution to cellular senescence. The authors demonstrate that as cells grow larger, their proteome undergoes significant remodeling, with an accumulation of stress and aging-associated proteins. This process promotes cellular senescence, a state where cells cease to divide and become functionally impaired, contributing to aging-related tissue dysfunction.

**Commentary**:  
The study reveals a crucial link between cell size and aging, suggesting that controlling cell size could be a potential strategy to delay or reverse cellular aging. By focusing on proteome remodeling, the research opens new avenues for exploring how metabolic and proteomic changes influence senescence and age-related diseases. The findings provide an important framework for therapeutic interventions targeting proteostasis and cellular size regulation.
