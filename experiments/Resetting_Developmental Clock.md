# Determining Effects of Resetting the Developmental Clock Repeatedly

![Reseting_Development_Clock_Experiment](../images/Reseting_Development_Clock_Experiment.png)

## Purpose
This experiment is designed to explore whether the repeated resetting of the developmental clock in early embryonic stages affects later stages of development. By dividing embryos at the two-cell stage and resetting their developmental clock repeatedly, we aim to determine if these manipulated embryos retain any developmental changes or signs of aging by the time they reach later stages, such as E15.5.

## Experimental Design

### Procedure
1. **Zygote Stage (E0.5)**: Begin with a single zygote at the E0.5 stage.
2. **Two-Stage Division (E2.0)**: Split the zygote into two-cell stage embryos (E2.0).
3. **Repeated Resetting of Clock**: Continue splitting and resetting the developmental clock back by half a day at multiple stages, including E2.5 and E3.0.
4. **Embryo Analysis (E15.5)**: Allow the embryos to develop to the E15.5 stage and assess whether any effects from the clock resetting persist.

### Controls
- **Untreated Embryos**: Embryos that develop without clock resetting serve as controls to compare normal development and aging patterns.
- **Partial Clock Resets**: Embryos where the clock was only reset once or at intermediate stages to determine the cumulative effects of repeated clock resets.

## Hypotheses and Predictions

### Outcome 1: **Developmental Clock Affects Aging**
- **Prediction**: Embryos subjected to repeated clock resets will show signs of altered development or aging patterns compared to controls.
- **Interpretation**: This would suggest that the developmental clock plays a significant role in determining aging processes at the cellular level.

### Outcome 2: **No Effect on Development or Aging**
- **Prediction**: Embryos that undergo repeated clock resets will develop normally and show no significant changes compared to control embryos.
- **Interpretation**: This would suggest that resetting the developmental clock does not influence later aging or developmental processes.

### Outcome 3: **Partial Effects of Clock Resetting**
- **Prediction**: Some embryos will show partial changes, either in their development timing or aging patterns, indicating that repeated resetting of the developmental clock has a cumulative but non-dominant effect.
- **Interpretation**: This outcome would imply that while the developmental clock influences aging, it is not the sole determinant, and other factors compensate during development.

## Implications of the Study
If resetting the developmental clock repeatedly alters the developmental or aging process, this could reveal new pathways for understanding how cellular aging is regulated. The study could provide insights into whether developmental signals influence longevity and whether these processes can be manipulated to delay aging.
