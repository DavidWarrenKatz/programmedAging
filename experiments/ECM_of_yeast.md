# Determining Extracellular Signals of Replicatively Old Yeast

![ECM_of_Yeast](../images/ECM_of_Yeast.png)

## Purpose
This experiment is designed to investigate the extracellular signaling molecules present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of replicatively old yeast cells. By comparing the ECM from old yeast cells obtained through the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) with ECM from young, exponentially budding yeast cells, we aim to identify the differences in signaling that might contribute to aging or rejuvenation processes.

## Experimental Design

### Procedure
1. **Old Yeast Culture**: Grow old yeast cells using the MEP to obtain a culture of replicatively old cells.
2. **Young Yeast Culture**: Grow young, exponentially budding yeast cells under standard growth conditions.
3. **Extracellular Medium Extraction**: Isolate the ECM from both the old and young yeast cultures by extracting the extracellular medium.
4. **ECM Analysis**: Analyze the signaling molecules present in the ECM using proteomic or other molecular biology techniques.

### Controls
- **Young Yeast ECM**: Use ECM from young yeast cells as a control to compare against the ECM from old yeast cells.
- **No ECM Extraction**: A control sample with no ECM extraction to ensure that the observed differences are specific to the ECM.

## Hypotheses and Predictions

### Outcome 1: **Old ECM Contains Aging Signals**
- **Prediction**: The ECM from old yeast will contain signaling molecules that promote aging or senescence.
- **Interpretation**: This suggests that extracellular signals play a role in promoting aging at the cellular level.

### Outcome 2: **No Difference in Signaling**
- **Prediction**: There will be no significant differences between the ECM of old and young yeast cells.
- **Interpretation**: This suggests that extracellular signaling does not contribute significantly to aging in yeast cells.

### Outcome 3: **Young ECM Promotes Rejuvenation**
- **Prediction**: The ECM from young yeast will contain signals that promote rejuvenation or delay aging.
- **Interpretation**: This indicates that the aging process might be influenced by external signals that can be manipulated to extend cellular lifespan.

## Implications of the Study
If the ECM of old yeast contains distinct aging signals compared to young yeast, this could reveal new pathways for understanding how cellular aging is influenced by external communication. The results could have broader implications for aging research, potentially identifying targets for interventions that modulate extracellular signaling to delay or reverse aging.
