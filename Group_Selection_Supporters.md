Below is a summary of well-known scientists who have written in support of **Group Selection**:

### August Weismann (1834 – 1914)
August Weismann was the first to distinguish between the **germline** (reproductive cells) and the **soma** (body cells), and the first to argue that aging was an **evolutionary adaptation**. He argued that aging helps ensure turnover in populations, which benefits the group by making room for younger individuals, thus promoting the evolutionary success of the species as a whole. This early concept laid the groundwork for the idea of **group selection**, where natural selection acts on the level of populations or species, rather than just individuals.
