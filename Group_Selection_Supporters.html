# In Progress
Below is a summary of well-known scientists who have written in support of **Group Selection**:

### August Weismann (1834 – 1914)
August Weismann was the first to distinguish between the **germline** (reproductive cells) and the **soma** (body cells), and the first to argue that aging was an **evolutionary adaptation**. He argued that aging helps ensure turnover in populations, which benefits the group by making room for younger individuals, thus promoting the evolutionary success of the species as a whole. This early concept laid the groundwork for the idea of **group selection**, where natural selection acts on the level of populations or species, rather than just individuals.

### V. C. Wynne-Edwards (1906 – 1997)
V. C. Wynne-Edwards was a prominent advocate of group selection in evolutionary theory. In his influential work, Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behaviour (1962), he argued that behaviors and traits in animals could evolve for the benefit of the group. I am not sure he ever discussed aging in an evolutionary context.

### George Price  (1922 – 1975)
George Price was a mathematician and evolutionary biologist who developed of the Price equation, a mathematical formula that describes how gene frequencies change over time in a population. This equation provided a framework to explain how traits that benefit groups, rather than just individuals, could evolve. Price defined fitness as number of fertile offspring, and thus thought that individual selection was much more powerful than group selection. However, even with this individual definition of fitness, Price beleived altruistic behaviors—which may reduce individual fitness but benefit the group—can still evolve if they enhance the survival and reproduction of the group as a whole.

### William R. Clark (1938 - )
William Clark was a Professor of Immunology at the University of California at Los Angeles, who wrote many books on aging. 

- **Sex and the Origins of Death** (1998): In this book, Clark explores the evolutionary origins of death, linking it to the emergence of sexual reproduction. He argues that the evolution of sex and the differentiation between the germline and somatic cells may have given rise to aging and programmed death, framing death as a byproduct of the evolutionary mechanisms that maximize reproductive success.
- **A Means to an End: The Biological Basis of Aging and Death** (2002): 

### Michael E. Gilpin (1938–2000) 
Michael Gilpin was an American ecologist best known for his work on metapopulation dynamics and group selection.
