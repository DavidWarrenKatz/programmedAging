# Life Stages for C57BL/6 Mice

1. **Embryogenesis**:  
   - Fertilization to approximately embryonic day 19 (E19).  
   - Mice are born around day 19–21 of gestation.

2. **Fetal Stage**:  
   - E12 to birth (~E19–21).  
   - This stage corresponds to organogenesis and late development.

3. **Infancy (Neonatal Period)**:  
   - Birth to 3 weeks (0–21 days).  
   - Includes suckling, rapid growth, and developmental milestones.

4. **Childhood (Juvenile Period)**:  
   - 3 weeks to 6 weeks (~22–42 days).  
   - Mice are weaned around 3–4 weeks and become fully independent.

5. **Adolescence**:  
   - 6 weeks to 8 weeks (~43–56 days).  
   - Sexual maturity occurs at this stage.

6. **Young Adulthood**:  
   - 2 months to 6 months.  
   - Peak physical performance and reproductive capacity.

7. **Adulthood**:  
   - 7 months to 14 months.  
   - Early signs of aging may start to appear.

8. **Youngest-old**:  
   - 15 months to 18 months.  
   - Aging processes become more pronounced.

9. **Old**:  
   - 19 months to 24 months.  
   - Significant aging markers; mice in this stage are considered old in experimental research.

10. **Oldest-old**:  
   - 25 months to 30 months.  
   - Few mice reach this age in standard colonies.

11. **Centenarians**:  
   - Equivalent to 30–36 months.  
   - Represents exceptional longevity in mice.

12. **Supercentenarians**:  
   - 36+ months.  
   - Very rare in laboratory or wild conditions.
