**S. Gulberk Ozcebe, Pinar Zorlutuna et al., Biomaterials, 2020**  

**Summary**:  
This paper investigates the impact of both cellular and ECM aging on the functionality, maturation, and senescence of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Zorlutuna and her team found that aging in both cells and ECM impairs the performance of these cardiomyocytes, leading to diminished cardiac functionality and promoting signs of cellular senescence. This work suggests that rejuvenating either the cells or the ECM could improve cardiomyocyte performance, with potential implications for aging-related cardiovascular diseases.

**Commentary**:  
The findings from this study are crucial for understanding how aging affects heart tissue and how stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes might be used in regenerative therapies. Zorlutuna's work emphasizes that addressing both cellular and ECM components of aging could be essential for improving the success of tissue engineering and cardiac regeneration strategies in aged individuals.
