# In Progress
Babies are born young. This means that adult organisms can produce new, young cells. Why then do adult organisms not regenerate a completely young body, just as a newt regenerates the lens of its eyes and even its entire limbs if needed [Goro Eguchi et al. (Nature Communications, 2011)]? 

The bodies of multicellular organisms are composed of cells that continuously undergo turnover—old cells die and are replaced by new ones. For example, in humans, skin cells, blood cells, and cells of the lining of the gut are frequently renewed. Why does this cellular turnover not result in the rejuvenation of the turned over cells? An old skin cell looks and behaves differently than a young skin cell, even if both of the cells were recently created [Jacob Kimmel et al. (Genome Res., 2019); William Allen et al. (Cell, 2023)]. How does the old cell ‘know’ to be born old, while the egg cell ‘knows’ to be born young?
More generally, how does a muscle cell ‘know’ to be a muscle cell, and a skin cell ‘know’ to be a skin cell? During the anaphase stage of mitosis, chromatin is in its most condensed form and is aligned in a row in preparation to be pulled toward opposite poles. At this stage, the chromatin of a muscle cell and the chromatin of a skin cell are visibly indistinguishable. Yet, once the cell transitions back to interphase, the skin cell ‘remembers’ its identity, expressing skin-specific genes and silencing muscle-specific genes. The cell’s identity is encoded somewhere, allowing the cell to ‘know’ what type of cell it is. The cell’s age is also encoded somewhere, allowing the cell to ‘know’ how old it is. 
This is how aging happens. The age of every cell is encoded somewhere in the cell and directs the cell’s behavior. Cells communicate their age with one another, which is how tissues collectively ‘sense’ their age and, ultimately, how the organism collectively ‘senses’ its age. This internal clock, stored somewhere within each cell, directs the gradual decline in fitness that is aging. Your body is not trying its best to survive. Your body is programmed to have the frailty and likelihood of death of an old person when its internal clock signals that it is old. 
Aging is the result of active self-destruction pathways governed by biological clocks. Babies are born young because they are programmed to be born young. The internal clock of the egg cell is set to zero. The skin cells of an old organism are born old because they are programmed to be born old - their internal clocks are not reset. 
Most biologists do not accept the existence of biological clocks that govern aging. It is widely accepted that cells have a 24-hour clock. It is widely accepted that puberty is triggered by developmental clocks. It is widely accepted that animals rely on internal annual clocks for breeding and hibernation cycles. However, the idea of lifelong clocks directing aging is met with strong skepticism. This skepticism is hindering progress in aging research.
The prevailing view is that aging is the result of an accumulation of intracellular and extracellular damage. According to this ‘damage accumulation’ theory, babies are born young because the egg cell, firstly, discards extracellular damage by building an entirely new extracellular environment, and, secondly, discards intracellular damage by dividing repeatedly to become the approximately one trillion cells of a multicellular organism. This ‘dilution hypothesis’ posits that any damage accumulated in the egg cell is diluted across one trillion daughter cells, rendering the damage negligible or easily manageable. 
However, this is not what we observe in nature. Research shows that the hallmarks of aging are erased early in embryogenesis [Ünal et al. (Science, 2011)], long before any significant dilution can occur. This suggests that cells have the ability to clear damage independently of dilution, yet old cells do not use this ability. Rather, old cells ‘know’ that they are old, and choose to allow damage to accumulate. Additionally, when old tissues are transplanted into young organisms, the old tissues are rejuvenated, including their extracellular matrices [Carlson et al. (J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci., 2001)]. This demonstrates that when old tissues receive signals to be young, they can clear any damage that has accumulated inside or outside the cells.

Yeast cells lacking Cdc5 are not able to undergo meiotic division, but are still able to sense nutrients deprivation and undergo sporulation. As a result, under conditions that normally induce sporulation in yeast, yeast cells lacking Cdc5 transition from a vegetative cell into a single spore rather than the usual four spores. This single spore is still born young. All hallmarks of aging are erased, including amyloid aggregates. Dilution and asymmetric division are not responsible for the clearing of amyloid, as there was no cell division. One interpretation is that the yeast cell always had the ability to clear amyloid without dilution or asymmetric division or any addition of energy. The yeast cell, however, allowed the damage to accumulate as directed by its aging program. The hypothesis that there is an aging clock upstream of amyloid accumulation directing the accumulation simply explains this observation of single yeast spores being born young. 

Old cells are not trying but failing to be young any more than a butterfly is trying but failing to be a caterpillar. Butterflies are designed to be butterflies, directed by signals from their biological clocks. Similarly, old cells are designed to be old cells, directed by signals from their biological clocks. 
Bamboo plants are a type of grass that sprout shoots every year from a shared underground root system. In certain species, such as Phyllostachys bambusoides, the plant transitions from vegetative growth to mass flowering at the end of its lifecycle. Remarkably, even when a shoot of this bamboo plant is transplanted to another location, the transplanted plant flowers decades later in synchronization with the original plant, regardless of external cues  [Jian Gao (Plos One, 2014)]. The transplanted bamboo plant ‘remembers’ how old it is, and flowers right on time. This suggests that the cells of a bamboo plant take signals from internal biological clocks, and, in response to these signals, die right on time. 
It is true that damage accumulates predictably with chronological age. In fact, the chronological age of an organism can often be determined by measuring the level of certain types of damage [Meyer et al., 2024]. However, this accumulation of damage is not the cause of aging. Instead, damage accumulation is downstream of biological clocks. When the clocks signal that the cells should be old, the cells allow damage to accumulate. This results in the organism becoming frail and more likely to die. 
In some species, organisms are programmed to die all at once, as seen in bamboo plants, octopuses, and cicadas. However, most organisms are programmed to age gradually by allowing damage to accumulate over time. Sudden death after reproduction is a clear example of programmed self-destruction. Though less obvious, gradual aging is also a form of programmed self-destruction, driven by active pathways under the influence of evolutionary forces. Evolution wants to prevent intergenerational breeding and overpopulation, and wants to make room for the chronologically young. Instead of eliminating the old all at once, older individuals are gradually phased out by transitioning them into grandparental roles. The grandparent zebra serves the important role of being at the back of the herd when the lion attacks, protecting the young from predation and providing food to the predators.  
Damage accumulation is a mechanism of aging, but the body is robust and can use other mechanisms if needed. Evolution is a problem-solving entity, and evolution sees non-aging as a large problem. This is why evolution has programmed your body to die right on schedule. Your body is also a problem-solving entity, and your body will find a way to die right on schedule in the face of various challenges. When building a machine, there is a tradeoff between optimizing for efficiency and optimizing for robustness. An efficient machine is designed to perform its tasks with minimal waste of resources, maximizing performance under ideal conditions. A robust machine, on the other hand, is designed to function reliably even when subjected to various stresses and unexpected challenges. Evolution favors robustness over efficiency. Your body is programmed to gradually age and die, and it is programmed to do so robustly.
Clearing damage will not extend lifespan in any significant way because your body’s clocks are still sending self-destruct signals. In response to these signals, your body will find a way to die right on schedule. Targeting the clock is the most promising approach for a meaningful intervention in the aging process. We must find out how the body ‘knows’ how old it is. 
There is reason to be optimistic about turning back the biological clock. While your body's aging program is resilient to many challenges, it is not invulnerable. Certain interventions can "trick" the body into perceiving itself as young. Just by starving yourself, you can successfully trick your body into thinking it is in an adverse environment, and trick your body into extending your lifespan. If the clock is turned back, your body will regain the same low probability of death as a younger person. Old bodies are not worn out. Old bodies retain the capacity to be young. For example, old skin cells can be reprogrammed into young brain cells. This demonstrates that old cells already possess the ability to repair any damage that has accumulated; they just need the right signals to revert to a youthful state.
 Rejuvenation is an evolutionarily conserved process seen across species—from fleas and planaria to lizards and humans. All organisms have the intrinsic capacity to regenerate if provided the appropriate signals. For instance, in chicken embryos, if the embryo is split in two before day four of embryogenesis, each piece can develop into a fully functional chicken [CITATION NEEDED]. In fact, this is how identical twins are born. If a chicken embryo is split in four pieces before embryogenesis day four, each piece becomes its own chicken. No where in the genome of the chicken is it specified what to do in the case that the embryo is divided in four. However, if the embryo receives the signal that it is before embryogenesis day four, the body finds a way to make a chicken from each piece. The developmental program is robust; the aging program is robust; and the youth program is robust. If we turn back the body’s clock, the body will find a way to be youthful indefinitely. 
A common criticism of the programmed theory of aging is the absence of long-lived mutants. If aging is truly programmed, we might expect to see humans with mutations in their biological clocks, allowing them to live dramatically longer—perhaps even more than 500 years. 
The reason there are no long-lived mutants is that the aging program is highly robust to spontaneous mutations. The aging program has developed ways to deal with the spontaneous mutations that arise in nature, just as the developmental program has developed ways to deal with the insult of the embryo being divided into two. To truly reverse aging, a more targeted and coordinated insult to the body is needed. Evolution, while robust, is not invincible. There are specific challenges to the genome and the body that evolution cannot handle. A coordinated and targeted insult to the body’s biological clocks is the most promising aging intervention. We need interventions that break things down and target the clock, not interventions that clear damage.
The lack of ‘immortal’ mutants in nature is indeed very significant, and is one of the strongest arguments for programmed aging. To understand this, it is important to differentiate between arbitrarily rare events and meaningfully rare events. Consider the example of a basketball player from Indiana making a shot from a particular point on a particular court while wearing green shorts. It is certainly true that a rare event has occurred. However, this is not a meaningfully rare event. This event is rare only due to arbitrary considerations like the color of the players' shorts. If the player were wearing blue shorts instead of green shorts, it is not clear the event would be more rare. For every meaningful rare event, there is always a clear way in which the event could have been more rare.
In contrast, imagine flipping 100 coins and having all of them land on heads. This is a meaningfully rare event because there is a clear way to make it even rarer: flipping 101 coins and having all of them land on heads as well. Meaningfully rare events do happen, and their occurrence or nonoccurrence can offer valuable insights. Over enough trials, we expect meaningfully rare events to happen, no matter how improbable they seem. 
For instance, if you conduct the coin-flipping experiment repeatedly, you would expect all 100 coins to land on heads eventually. However, if after an extraordinary number of trials such an outcome never occurs, we would increasingly question the assumption that the coins are independent and fair. Instead, it would be likely that there was some mechanism preventing this rare outcome—something that keeps track of the coin flips and interferes to ensure that not all coins land on heads. 
If organisms die as a result of the aging program allowing damage to accumulate, we would expect some organisms to live much longer than others simply by chance. If aging were merely the result of random damage building up over time, and populations were large enough, then we would expect some individuals to avoid damage long enough to live vastly beyond their expected lifespan. Yet, this is not what we observe in nature. There is strong evidence that organisms have a biologically programmed maximum lifespan. Aging interventions generally extend median lifespan without extending maximum lifespan. Aging interventions generally result in ‘squared’ survival curves, where organisms spend more of their life healthy, but all the organisms still die around the same upper limit. Like the coins that seem to be ‘watched’ by some external force to ensure they don’t all land on heads, the aging process appears to be regulated in such a way that no individual escapes the built-in limits of their biological lifespan. 
The concept of a biologically programmed maximum lifespan suggests that organisms may possess a death program separate from their aging program. The aging program, governed by biological clocks, allows damage to accumulate gradually, reducing an organism’s fitness and transitioning the organisms into a more vulnerable grandfatherly role. Over time, this damage makes survival less likely, but it does not directly cause death. Instead, the existence of a maximum lifespan suggests the presence of a death program—a programmed mechanism, also governed by biological clocks, that ensures an organism dies at a certain point, regardless of accumulated damage. This death program may work similarly to the well-known death programs observed in species like bamboo plants, octopuses, and cicadas, where organisms die all at once after reproduction.
It is important to note that some organisms do indeed produce long-lived mutants. For example, research by Volpe demonstrated that in populations of millions of fruit flies, which typically live around 20 days, there were always a few flies that lived over 200 days. This kind of extreme lifespan extension in a minority of individuals suggests that there is no maximum lifespan or death program in fruit flies. However, for most species, including humans, there does seem to be a death program governed by biological clocks. If this is true, a coordinated and targeted insult to the body’s biological clocks is the most promising intervention into the body’s aging and death programs.
The programmed aging hypothesis is largely ignored because it goes against the prevailing view of evolution. According to the prevailing view, the purpose of an organism is to survive, reproduce, and pass on its genes. Once reproduction has occurred, there is less evolutionary pressure to maintain the body in a youthful state. Furthermore, any evolutionary trade-offs between fertility and longevity are ultimately decided in the favor of fertility. This prevailing view, when applied to unicellular organisms, prescribes that the dream of every cell is to become two cells. However, this is not what we observe in nature. For multicellular organisms, the dream of every cell is to play its role in the larger ecosystem, even if it means not replicating, decreasing its own fitness, and even taking its own life. This is actually the dream of unicellular organisms as well.  The dream of every cell, both of unicellular and multicellular organisms, is to play its role in the larger ecosystem. This usually means dying right on schedule. 
 
The common narrative suggests that all cellular pathways are geared toward survival, growth, reproduction, and proper functioning. The common narrative views apoptosis as something only cells of multicellular organisms partake in. When apoptosis is triggered in a cell of a multicellular organism, the cell activates a markedly different set of pathways than its normal functioning pathways that lead to its orderly and self-directed death. But this is not what we observe in nature. Apoptosis is not a dramatic shift in a cell’s behavior. The pathways and signals involved in apoptosis are a part of the larger network of signals and pathways involved in all cellular functions. 

The only way cells could become multicellular is if they all share the same DNA. As if DNA were just programming of the cell!  The DNA is what gets passed on! Not so, the lipids get passed on. Almost everything gets passed on. 

Apoptosis is an orderly and controlled self-destruction for the benefit of the organism. All cells have this self-destruction built into them. All cells orderly decline in fitness for the benefit of the ecosystem. They want to make the organism less fit in order to transition into a different role in the ecosystem. To become a grandfather. The cell essentially "decides" to die for the greater benefit of the organism, transitioning from a state of survival to self-destruction in a controlled manner to prevent harm to the surrounding tissues and maintain overall health.

The prevailing view of evolution is engrained in the mindset that it is a dog-eat-dog world in nature. However, it is a myth that nature is red in tooth and claw. It is a myth that nature is characterized by cutthroat competition and brutal predation. It is a myth that individuals ruthlessly look out for their own interests at the expense of others. 

This is not what we observe in nature. This is perhaps what your mind focuses on based on your own fears. This is perhaps what you remember most vividly from nature documentaries. But this is not what we observe in nature. The large majority of animals in the wild - both predators and prey species - reach the age of senescence. The number one cause of death in the wild is not disease nor predation. The number one cause of death in the wild is old age. If nature were red in tooth and claw, it would be uncommon for organisms to reach old age. This is not what we observe in nature.  

Animals are designed to become old so they will be eaten by predators and predators play an important role in keeping the population of prey species in check. 

What we do observe in nature is harmonious interdependence. Symbiotic relationships exist among all branches of the tree of life. Insects pollinate plants and fish disperse the germ cells of molluscs. Fungi recycle waste, and bacteria manufacture chemicals crucial for all life. Cooperation and interdependence is the most striking feature of every ecosystem. The maintenance of this careful harmony is most simply explained by altruistic sacrifice. The cells in your body exemplify altruism. Each cell sacrifices its individual interests for the collective good of the organism. Altruism resonates beyond the cellular level in nature. Social organisms like ants, wasps, and naked mole rats, each compromise their individual well-being for the benefit of the colony. Altruistic sacrifice is not confined to close kin and social organisms. Rather, biologically-programmed altruism is integral to maintaining the homeostasis of ecosystems. 

In certain strains of rats, the vaginal opening of females forms right before first ovulation [1]. Any bodily opening is a potential source of infection. Thus, the strategic timing of vaginal formation in female rats helps prevent infections, which are much more serious for small-bodied animals [2]. The formation of the vaginal opening is achieved through apoptosis [3]. Millions of cells undergo programmed self-destruction at precisely the right moment to facilitate the formation of the vaginal opening. The synchronization of these events is intricately woven into the rat's biological programming and is governed by specific hormonal changes. Apoptosis is a fundamental biological phenomenon which plays a pivotal role in ensuring the orderly development and differentiation of nearly all structures in multicellular organisms. By definition, the dream of an apoptotic cell is to die right on time. By observation, the dream of, in fact, every cell is to die right on time. 

Ecosystems are designed for robustness. When designing a machine, an engineer faces a trade-off between making the machine efficient or making the machine robust. An efficient machine is one that performs its intended task with minimal waste. A robust machine, on the other hand, is designed to perform reliably across a wide range of conditions. Evolution has not designed organisms to die in the most efficient way possible. Evolution has designed organisms to die in a robust way. Evolution has designed organisms to die right on time regardless of the variety of insults and circumstances they encounter throughout their lives. Evolution has selected for aging and has selected for aging in a robust manner.

Evolution has selected for aging in order to achieve robust ecosystems. Ecosystems are designed for robustness. Ecosystems are designed to withstand various environmental challenges. Crucial to this stability is the prevention of any single individual or any single species from overwhelming the ecosystem. Dominance by one individual or one species would mean the entire ecosystem would be disrupted by the loss of a single individual or species. To maintain equilibrium in ecosystems, organisms have inherent limitations built into them, such as the need to sleep and aging. 

The need to sleep is disadvantageous for the individual, but it plays a vital role in preserving the ecosystem's harmony. There is no biological reason why organisms must sleep. There is no law of biology that says organisms cannot remain active indefinitely. However, the need to sleep is built into almost all organisms. Some birds even sleep while flying long distances over oceans! Ecosystems cannot allow for any one individual to undergo constant activity. Ecosystems cannot allow for any one species to undergo uncontrolled population growth. This is why almost all organisms are biologically programmed to die right on time. Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of the ecosystem. 

In 1993, Cynthia Kenyon and her colleagues revealed that a single gene mutation in daf-2 could double the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans [Kenyon et al. (1993, Nature)]. Since then, numerous gene mutations that extend lifespan in a variety of species, from yeast to mammals. In mice, mutations in the p66Shc gene can extend lifespan by about 30% [Migliaccio et al. (1999, Nature)]. In fruit flies, mutations in the Methuselah gene and the I’m Not Dead Yet gene have similarly been shown to significantly increase lifespan. Aging is not only not immutable, but can be significantly modulated by altering a single gene. Evolution is clearly not trying its best to extend lifespan. These genes are part of conserved pathways. Evolution is doing its best to limit lifespan. Evolution is a problem-solving entity, and evolution sees non-aging as a large problem. That is why evolution has designed every organism to die right on time. 

All rivers flow into the sea, and yet the sea is never full. Kohelet, the author of Ecclesiastes, made this observation thousands of years ago. From this observation, Kohelet concluded that the seas must somehow flow back into the rivers. Since water flows into the rivers by way of the rain, the rain must therefore come from the ocean. What Kohelet observed was the living and dynamic circulatory system of an ecosystem. Let us also observe this circulatory system, and let us also use our powers of reasoning to understand the world around us. 

As the rain flows back into the oceans, it drags some of the sediments of the Earth’s surface with it. These sediments are deposited into the oceans, which is why the seas are so salty. The soil of the Earth is constantly adjusting to different conditions of climate and life. Thus, the soils deposited on the ocean’s floor form layers that are constantly changing. As these soils are compacted into rock, they form a record of our world as it existed at that point in time. This is the fossil record. The fossil record is the answer to a mystery that puzzled our ancestors. Our ancestors gazed up at towering mountain sides and wondered why the mountains were striated. The answer is that the striated mountains were once striated ocean floors that have been pushed up towards the skies by the powerful movement of the Earth’s crust. 

The fossil record in the striations of mountains and the layers of Earth’s crust give us a glimpse into the past. The remains of life-forms that lived millions of years ago are embedded into the strata. By estimating the age of each strata, we can also estimate when the species whose remains are found in the strata onced lived. This gives us a remarkable image of the succession of different life-forms over time. The most striking pattern in the fossil record is the succession from simple life-forms to complex life-forms, and from simple ecosystems to diverse ecosystems. It is widely and adamantly believed that evolution does not have a direction. But that is not what we observe in nature. What we do observe in nature is that ecosystems are becoming more complex, more diverse, and more integrated. 

The incredible interdependence of life is evident in every liter of seawater and every handful of soil, both of which can contain thousands of different microbial species. All of these microorganisms are interdependent. Less than one percent of all known bacterial species can be grown in pure culture. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘The Great Plate Count Anomaly’. Like most ‘anomalies’, this phenomenon is just an observation that requires a small change in one’s worldview. This is harder than it may sound, for a small change in one’s worldview can require a large change in one’s behavior. 

You may have grown the bacterium E. Coli in a Petri dish in your biology class. What they did not tell you was that E. Coli is the exception to the rule. E. Coli is not a representative bacterium. Unlike almost all other bacteria, E. Coli can be grown in pure culture. In fact, each E. Coli cell is a cell that dreams of becoming two cells. E. Coli often begins dividing even before its current division has completed. In contrast, however, The large majority of bacteria do not engage in unconstrained reproduction, and in fact will not reproduce if the balance of the ecosystem is upset. Many bacteria will actively destroy themselves if they sense that their survival would be detrimental to the ecosystem. The large majority of bacterial species function as a network of interacting cells rather than as autonomous units. This collaboration is not driven by competition but rather by a mutual benefit. 

Almost all microorganisms lack even the genes necessary to synthesize metabolites essential for their own survival. Almost all microorganisms rely on metabolites produced by genetically distant microorganisms. But this should come as no surprise. No organism can survive outside an ecosystem. No organism exists in isolation from its ecosystem. An organism is not an independent unit, but, rather, one part in a larger whole. Every life form, from humans to bacteria, relies on compounds generated by other organisms spanning the entire tree of life. Organisms do not have to be built in this way. Organisms could have been built to be autonomous and self-sufficient just like a cell of E Coli. But this is not what we observe in nature. Interdependence and altruistic sacrifice are built into every cell and into the body of every organism.  

You cannot study an ant colony by studying an ant in a Petri dish. An ant in a Petri dish is a perversion of an ant colony. An ant colony is a highly organized and cooperative social structure where individual ants work together for the survival and success of the colony. An ant in a dish, on the other hand,  is an ant in a dish. Each individual bacterium is a part of a larger ecosystem. Each individual tree is part of a larger forest. Each individual organism is part of a larger ecosystem. Each organism sacrifices its own wellbeing for the collective wellbeing of the ecosystem. Altruistic sacrifice is the most striking characteristic of every ecosystem, and this characteristic is overlooked when you study individuals removed from their ecosystems. 

Scientists study humans as if they lived in Petri dishes. But no individual can be removed from its ecosystem. No species can survive outside an ecosystem. Mankind’s one attempt to create an artificial ecosystem fell flat on its face in a matter of weeks. This failed attempt was dubbed Biosphere Two, and involved creating a giant dome enclosing over three acres in Arizona. No molecules were allowed to pass between Biosphere Two - the domed enclosure -  and Biosphere One - the earth. So-called scientists brought into Biosphere Two  all the elements, animals, and plants they believed necessary to maintain an ecosystem. They had, afterall, observed all these organisms in Petri dishes. As should be no surprise, almost everything in Biosphere Two was dead in a matter of weeks. Mankind is nowhere close to understanding the interconnections necessary to create a functional ecosystem. Most of the macroscopic species and almost all of the microscopic species have yet to even be cataloged. 

The homeostasis of your body is not the aggregate result of each cell looking out for its own self-interest. Rather, each cell sacrifices its own well-being for the good of the organism, just as each ant, each wasp, and each naked mole rat sacrifices its own well-being for the good of the colony. The homeostasis of each ecosystem is likewise maintained by altruistic sacrifice. What keeps the system honest? The cell is not able to create an entire new organism by itself. It can be then argued that this is what keeps the system honest. 

Consider, for example, the Tribolium castaneum, or the red flour beetle. When flour beetles experience high population density, they can engage in a phenomenon known as density-dependent prophylaxis. This phenomenon involved the female flour beetles releasing anti-aphrodisiac pheromones, which discourage males from attempting to mate with them. This population control mechanism helps prevent overcrowding and resource depletion, contributing to the overall stability and sustainability of the beetle population at the expense of the individual beetle’s reproductive fitness. What keeps the system honest? What prevents evolution for selecting mutations that interfere with the density-dependent prophylaxis pathways in order to increase the individual fitness of the mutant beetles? Literally, every fabric of the beetle’s biology keeps the system honest. The beetle is a machine designed to die right on time. Evolution has selected for 

It is difficult to determine whether or not any single instance of mutual cooperation is the result of altruistic sacrifice. Consider, for example, the trees. Trees are plants that grow very tall, invite insects to live in their bodies by attracting them with nectar, and share nutrients with each other through networks of roots. One explanation for all these observations is that individual trees are selfishly looking out for their own interests. The trees grow tall due to runaway competition to hog more sunlight. The trees invite certain insects to live in their bodies so that these insects can protect them from other insects. The trees share nutrients with other trees that are close to them physically and thus are likely to be their close genetic cousins. However, all of these observations can also be explained more simply as altruism. It comes as no surprise that altruistic trees nourish each other through networks of root systems and invite insects to establish communities in their own bodies. It comes as no surprise that an altruistic tree would grow tall even in the absence of competition, for this is the height the plant needs to be in order to convert humidity into precipitation that benefits everything around it. Although it is difficult to determine whether any single instance of mutual cooperation is the result of altruistic sacrifice, it is clear that the level of interdependence and cooperation that exists in every ecosystem is most simply explained by altruistic sacrifice. 

To say A is the cause of death means that A happened and the organism died, but if A didn't happen, then the organism would have lived  significantly longer. It is counterfactual by its very nature. If the organism dies, you can always look for problems, such as something clogging the heart or some buildup in the brain, or  some other "damage". However, how do you know that "damage" actually lead to the death of the organism? Perhaps the so-called damage was only correlated to the cause of death and not directly related. Cause of death is a very important question, but as far as I know, no one has come up with a way to determine cause of death. Most autopsies are nonsense and political. Most studies that say mice get cancer and rats  dies of heart disease are based on nothing.

You Must Train Your Body To Be Young
It is hard to learn as a child because children have not developed a narrative. A child has no framework to organize the vast amount of information he encounters. The child must gradually construct a narrative to make sense of the universe. 
It is hard to learn as an adult because adults have developed a narrative. The adult’s pre-existing framework shapes how they interpret new information. Adults distort facts to make them fit within established beliefs. This leads to a distorted understanding of the universe. 
You need a narrative to organize information and navigate the world. But you must hold onto your narrative very lightly. All narratives are inherently flawed. The universe will never make sense to you. Rebuilding your narrative is challenging because small shifts in how you see the world often demand significant changes in how you live. But constantly rebuilding your narrative is necessary in order to not live in falsehood. If you hold onto a false worldview, your decisions will not align with how the world actually works, and you will not be able to recognize very real opportunities. 
You may think that because you have achieved some level of comfort, your worldview is working just fine. But there are far greater opportunities you are missing out on, ones that are invisible to you with your current narrative. If you knew more, you would look back at your present beliefs and realize how limited they were. 
Your present worldview is death cope, but death is not inevitable. Life is flourishing at the grand old age of four billion years, and there is no reason why you cannot flourish at that age as well. Your body knows how to be young indefinitely, and just needs to be trained to be young indefinitely. 
Let’s consider an observation and discuss how it fits into your narrative. 
The air around us is composed of various molecules, about twenty percent of which are diatomic oxygen. Each diatomic oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms bonded together by sharing four electrons. According to the narrative of the fundamental forces, each oxygen atom is a mindless particle with specific properties—such as charge, mass, and spin—and its behavior is entirely governed by those properties, a few fundamental forces, and perhaps some randomness. The presence of diatomic oxygen in our atmosphere is explained by how these particles interact under the omnipresent and far-reaching electromagnetic force.
Alternatively, according to the narrative of problem-solving entities, each oxygen atom is viewed as a purposeful agent, with the goal of filling its valence shell. The formation of diatomic oxygen, then, is seen as the result of these atoms finding a way to share electrons to meet their goals. Both narratives describe the same physical phenomenon but offer different lenses—one grounded in deterministic forces and the other in goal-directed behavior.
Most people indeed understand the formation of diatomic oxygen in this way, imagining two oxygen atoms ‘wanting’ to fill their valence shells and ‘finding a way’ to form a molecule to achieve this goal. Yet, when pressed, most will concede that they ‘know’ the narrative of the omnipresent fundamental forces is closer to ‘actual reality’ because, of course, atoms don’t have goals—only living beings, like humans, can have goals!

However, neither the narrative of the fundamental forces nor the narrative of problem-solving entities is inherently closer to reality—whatever “closer to reality” might mean. In fact, both narratives are equally powerful in their ability to predict outcomes, and thus, are equally scientific. Both frameworks are remarkably successful at making predictions, both are useful in organizing observations, and, ultimately, both are wrong—like all narratives. 
The narrative of the fundamental forces has been made more rigorous but is not inherently more rigorous than the narrative of problem-solving entities. The narrative of problem-solving entities could be made just as rigorous. The fundamental forces narrative struggles with key issues, such as explaining how these forces act over vast distances. The problem-solving entities narrative, on the other hand, only requires local interactions—where each entity acts based on its immediate environment—eliminating the need for distant forces. 
The narrative of problem-solving entities also has the advantage of better addressing emergent phenomena. The fundamental forces narrative has the challenge of explaining how goal-directed beings, such as humans, can emerge from the interactions of mindless particles. In the problem-solving entities framework, this challenge is bypassed, as each particle is already a problem-solver, so goal-oriented behavior doesn’t have to “emerge” from non-goal-seeking particles. 
The narrative of fundamental forces also faces a significant issue: we don’t actually know how many fundamental forces there are. There is an ongoing effort to reduce all forces to a single, unified force or at least a very small number of forces. This stems from an implicit acknowledgment by proponents of this narrative that invoking a large number of forces to explain everything would be a highly unsatisfactory and absurd framework. In contrast, the problem-solving entities narrative doesn’t face this dilemma. 
Many people who prefer the narrative of fundamental forces do so because they want humans, and life in general, to be special. Just as ancient people wanted to believe the Earth was the center of the universe, there’s a modern tendency to believe that lifeforms like humans are distinct from the mindless particles that make up the rest of the universe. This narrative allows for the comforting belief that living beings, particularly humans, emerged from and are fundamentally different from the basic particles and forces that govern the non-living world.
The narrative of problem-solving entities does not place humans in a special or distinct category and is particularly useful in biology, where the concept of problem-solving entities aligns naturally with the goal-directed behaviors seen in living organisms. Biological systems—from single cells to entire ecosystems—can be understood as entities that are constantly solving problems related to survival and stability. 
Let’s consider a biological observation and discuss how it fits into your narrative.
If a chicken embryo is divided in half, it can develop into two embryos, which is how identical twins are formed. According to the narrative of the fundamental forces, the cells of the embryo are viewed as mindless entities, their behavior entirely directed by programming, which itself is shaped by evolutionary forces. The emergence of two chickens from a divided embryo is explained as a consequence of this programming—the genetic instructions were "designed" directly or indirectly to handle such occurrences.
On the other hand, the narrative of problem-solving entities offers a more elegant explanation. In this view, the cells of the chicken embryo are not passive, mindless entities but problem-solving agents with the goal of becoming a chicken. When the embryo is cut in half, the cells face a challenge but still find a way to reach their goal, reorganizing to form two embryos. 
This perspective implies that every cell knows how old it is. Every cell know it is part of an organism in embryogenesis day one and behaves according to reach its goal. When they embryo is divided in half, the cells still know how old they are. 



the grass is a problem-solving entity with the goal of growing blades every growing season. The concrete sidewalk presents a problem to the grass, but the grass often finds a way reach its goal despite this obstacle.
All narratives are wrong, but I believe the narrative of problem-solving entities is preferable since this narrative is less prone to the problem of forcing all new facts into your 

People that support the narrative of the fundamental forces, know that the existence of all-knowing and all-powerful forces is fantastical. Thus, they strive to reduce everything to a small number of forces. This leads to huge errors.

The problem of emergence. There is no emergence. Everything can be viewed as a problem-solving entity, and everything can be viewed as mindless. Both are two ways of making the same observation.

How to train a mouse to navigate a maze? 
The naïve approach is to rewire its brain. There is no way to give the mouse a new ability without rewiring the brain to some extent, so in order to teach the mouse a new behavior, it is best to rewire its brain directly. 
Another approach is to intervene downstream of rewiring the brain by rewiring the mouse’s genome. That is, infect the mouse with viruses that change its genes so that the new genetic program induces neuronal rewiring. This may allow for more precise rewiring.
