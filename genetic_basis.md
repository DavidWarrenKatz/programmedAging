# There is an aging program with a large genetic component.

### Heritability of Lifespan

The queen ant lives for many years, while worker ants, despite having the same genome, survive only a single season. Thus, aging involves more than just genetic factors. Regardless of whether the gene is the only unit of heritability that is relevent to aging, it is clear that aging is heritable. Maximum and average lifespan are stabally transmitted from one generation to the next. Below, I am going to present evidence for the genetic component of the aging program, but this program may also be embedded in non-genetic components, such as information stored in cellular structures like centrioles (Marshall, 2009). 

Maximum lifespan remains constant when organimss are removed from the wild and kept in laboratory conditions, indicating that maximum lifespan is due to internal factors. Maximum lifespan is different for organisms in the same ecological niche, meaning that maximum lifespan has to due to internal factors and no the niche. 

Maximum lifespan is not measured in chronological time. For example, if yeast cells are put in low temperatures, they divide slower and their replicatie and actual lifespan is increased. The lifespan of many organisms is markedly affetced by temperature. 

### Genetic Basis of Lifespan 

An organism’s lifespan has a strong genetic component, as evidenced by the following four observations: 

1. **There are often large species-specific differences in lifespan.**

2. **Different genotypes of the same species often have different average lifespans. The most striking example of this in many species is the sex difference in lifespan.**
 
3. **There are often family patterns of lifespan in heterogeneous populations.**

4. **Aging genes —genes that, when knocked out, extend lifespan—have been found in every species in which they have been sought.**

Firstly, there are differences in lifespan between biologically similar species. For example, the Pacific Ocean rockfish Sebastes minor has an avergae lifespan of 11 years, while the Pacific rockish Sebastes aleutianus has an average lifespan of more than 200 years [Kolora, S. R. et al., 2021] [Love, M. S. et al., 2002]. Another example is the Myotis brandtii bat can live well over thirty years [Seim, I. e tal, 2013], while the Molossus molossus bat has a lifespan of less than 10 years [Gager, Y. et al., 2016]. In such examples, it is likely that small genetic differences are the cause of these large differences in average lifespan. However, it could be that non-genetic factors, such as slight differences in ecological niches, contribute to these lifespan disparities. To address this, we turn to additional lines of evidence.

Within a species, one of the most profound distinguishing characteristics between organisms is sex. Sex is genetically determined, and there is a consistent difference in average lifespan between sexes, even when accounting for external factors like predation or accidental deaths [Feraldi, A. et al., 2022]. 

Furthermore, in heterogeneous populations, such as the United States, genetic influences on lifespan are evident from family patterns of lifespan. Monozygotic twins, who share nearly identical genetic material, have more similar life spans than those of dizygotic twins, who have less similar genetic material. Likewise, in heterogeneous populations, siblings have more similar lifespans than more distant relatives or unrelated individuals. Familial patterns of lifespan are less pronounced in more homogeneous populations, such as Sweden, since individuals in homogenous populations already share a large amount of genetic material. Hence, the genetic disparity between siblings and more distant relatives is smaller. Together, these three observations provide robust evidence that genetics play a critical role in shaping life span. 

Furthermore, aging genes are evolutionarily conserved. Why then has evolution not selected for greater longevity?

There is a difference in average lifespan between men and women. However, there is no difference in maximum lifespan between men and women. There have been improvements in average lifespan that can be attributed to public health, medicine and accident prevention. However, there has been no improvement in maximum lifespan. The cause of death changes dramatically, but maximum lifespan stays the same. When infectious disease is removed as a cause of death, cancer and cardiovascular disease take its place to ensure huamns still die right on time.
