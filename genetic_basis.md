# Genetic Basis of Lifespan 

An organism’s lifespan has a strong genetic component, as evidenced by three key observations: 

1. **There are often large species-specific differences in lifespan.**

2. **Different genotypes of the same species have different average lifespans. Often the most striking example of this is the significant sex differences in lifespan within a species.**
 
3. **There are often significant family patterns of lifespan in heterogeneous populations.**

4. **Aging genes —genes that, when knocked out, extend lifespan—have been found in every species in which they have been sought.**

Firstly, there are dramatic differences in lifespan between biologically similar species who occupy similar niches, indicating that small genetic differences can have a large influence on an organism's average lifespan. Within a species, one of the most profound distinguishing characteristics between organisms is sex. Sex is genetically determined, and there is a consistent difference in average lifespan between sexes, even when accounting for external factors like predation or accidental deaths. 
Furthermore, in heterogeneous populations, such as the United States, genetic influences on lifespan are evident from family patterns of lifespan. Monozygotic twins, who share nearly identical genetic material, have more similar life spans than those of dizygotic twins, who have less similar genetic material. Likewise, in heterogeneous populations, siblings have more similar lifespans than more distant relatives or unrelated individuals. Familial patterns of lifespan are less pronounced in more homogeneous populations, such as Sweden, since individuals in homogenous populations already share a large amount of genetic material. Hence, the genetic disparity between siblings and more distant relatives is smaller. 
Together, these three observations provide robust evidence that genetics play a critical role in shaping life span. Furthermore, aging genes are evolutionarily conserved. Why then has evolution not selected for greater longevity?
